# Data Science with R

This is a repository where all the resources related to statistical analysis, learning and overall data science will be uploaded as I progress though the materials. This will include my own .R codes for my future reference and for others. 

At a bare minimum, I expect to cover the following within the next year (I will updare this as I go):

Summer 2015

* swirl + Coursera's Data Science [ 1, 2 ]
* Intro to Descriptive Stats  + Intro to Inferential Stats (Udacity)
* Data Analysis with R (Udacity)

Fall 2015

* Coursera's Data Science [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]
* Statistical Learning (Stanford) + textbook

Spring 2016

* Coursera's Data Science [ 8, 9 ]
* "Machine Learning for Hackers" textbook
