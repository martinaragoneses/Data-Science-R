## `lapply()`

```{r}
x <- list(a = 1:5, b = rnorm(10))
lapply(x, mean)  ## lapply(x, function, ...)
y <- 1:4
lapply(y, runif)
```

Anonymous functions

```{r}
x <- list(a = matrix(1:4, 2, 2), b = matrix(1:6, 3, 2))
# we get the first column in each matrix
lapply(x, function(e) e[, 1])
```

## `sapply()`

```{r}
x <- list(a = 1:16, b = rnorm(30), c = 3:5, d = rnorm(3, 4))
sapply(x, mean)
```

## `apply()`

```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(20), 2, 10)
apply(x, 1, quantile, probs = c(0.25, 0.75)) # collaps into and keep the rows
```
